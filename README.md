# gifaria

This project is a submission by [John Cassil](http://johncassil.com) & [Tiger Tang](https://github.com/CodingTigerTang/) for [Sefaria](https://www.sefaria.org)'s Powered by Sefaria [Contest](http://sefaria.nationbuilder.com/contest).

We decided to make a fun project to integrate the Sefaria & Giphy APIs.  We call the Sefaria API to build dropdowns for the user to select a book & chapter from the tanakh, and to display the text. When a user clicks on a verse, we call the Giphy API (using the text of the verse) to return (hopefully) relevant & fun gifs.

We hope that this project provides an engaging way for people to interact with biblical texts in a lighthearted way.  The project is currently hosted at [shinyapps.io](https://tiger-tang.shinyapps.io/gifaria/).

Disclaimer: Gifs from giphy have not been vetted, beyond simply ensuring that they are not NSFW.  We recognize that some gifs may be inappropriate for the texts and apologize for anything inappropriate.
